# ECPDailyChallenge

Daily challenge on algorithm, using different languages. From different problems to be solved.

## Structure Workflow

- The Repository is devided into months and each month has folders for every day in that month

- The Task_Template file shows how the problems are divided.

- The Algorithm template is to show how the algorithms for each problem should be structured.

## NOTE: Students are not allowed to make Changes to the to any of the Algorithm, Task or this file
